# Lightning Exercises for JS Review

## Set One

1. Use the `var` keyword to instantiate and assign a variable called `myName` that holds the value of your name (a string)
2. Use the `let` keyword to instantiate and assign a variable called `numberOfPets` that holds the number of pets you hvae
3. Use the `const` keyword to instantiate and assign a variable called `socialSecurity` that holds a fake social security number (please don't use your real one, I'll get in trouble)

## Set Two

1. Instantiate and assign a variable called `petNames` that stores an array of the names of your pets' names (as strings). If you don't have any pets, or just have one, make up a few.
2. Loop through your `petNames` array and log each pet's name to the console.

# Lightning Exercises for Objects

## Set One

Lightning Exercise 1: Given two options of data structures - array or object - which should you use? You need to represent a red 2015 Ford Mustang in your code.

Lightning Exercise 2: Given two options of data structures - array or object - which should you use? You need to store list of animal names in a shelter. The names are "Kippers", "Jack", "Gypsy", "Angus", "Seymour Bouts", and "Sharky".

Lightning Exercise 3: Define an object for four family members, and put each object in an array named familyMembers. Each family member object that you create should have the same keys on them, but the values will be different.

## Lightning Exercise Set Two

Lightning Exercise: Given the object below, output each of the values to the console using dot notation.

```
const wardrobe = {
    height: 80,
    manufacturer: "Killibrew & Sons",
    contents: ["Dress shirt", "Jeans", "Suit", "Skirt", "Tennis shoes"],
    depth: 38,
    width: 50
}
```

## Lightning Exercise Set Three

```
const empireStateBuilding = {
    stories: 103,
    height: 1453,
    address: "350 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, New York 10118",
    squareFeet: 2768591,

}
```

Lightning Exercises 1: Use dot notation to output all of the dimensions of the Empire State Building to the console.

Lightning Exercises 2: Use square bracket notation to output the remaining 5 properties to the console. Create 5 variables first with the keys as their values. Use those variables to look up the values.

## Lightning Exercise Set Four

```
const newForce = {
    founded: 2018,
    instructors: {
        fullTime: ["Jordan", "Josh", "Kim"],
    },
    careerAdvisors: ["Natalie", "Kinsey"],
    address: "1000 5th Ave, Huntington, WV 25701"
