// Objects to represent people and things in a coffee shop (barista, cup of coffee, customer, etc)

// Arrays represent collections of things where you don't need to know anything else about them. (Ingredients, customer names, etc.)


// LIGHTNING EXERCISE SET ONE

// Access the properties inside an array with brakcet notation
// Access properties in an object with dot notation
// OR access the properties inside an object with bracket notation 

// Bracket notation is generally used when we have a string stored in a variable that corresponds to a key in the object

// In the family array example, we might start with:
// const keyToLookUp = "name";

// LIGHTNING EXERCISE SET THREE
// const kennel = {
//   name: "Nashville North Kennels",
//   address: "100 Demonbreun Road",
//   manager: "Harper Frankstone",
//   capacity: 50,
//   currentAnimals: ["Jet", "Snickers", "Blue", "Jacks", "Flap", "Barnum"]
// }

// Loop through the current animals at the kennel
